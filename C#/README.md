# Diff between C# and .NET
C# is a programming language
.NET is a framework for building applications on windows. .NET is consist of two component
1. CLR (Common Language Runtime): When C# program is compiled, the resulting executable code is in an
intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).
This code is not machine-specific, and it can run on any platform that has the CLR installed. When the CIL
code is executed, the CLR compiles it into machine code that can be executed by the processor.
    The CLR provides many services to .NET applications, including memory management, type safety,
security, and exception handling. It also provide Just-In-Time(JIT) compilation, which compiles the CIl
code into machine code on the fly as the program runs, optimizing performance.
2. Class Library
